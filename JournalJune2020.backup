This day felt like it started and ran ahead, before my bearing could be caught and held up.

**01/06/2020 23:04**

The pages fall away from my hands today and I lay in a place of forgetting.
My alter ego I call tiredness knows only the peace of slumber. 

Hearing the poem of william carlos williams, the doctor that he was and poet too.
Shame rushed to my ears, why am I so tired and cannot find the time to write poetry?
When people held parallel careers all along, the very poets that I admire.

Kafka ocourse is my greatest reminder, with his full time job as an insurance broker. 
Writing a genre of his own and dubbing works like his: kafkaesque, oh what pinnacle of literature.

I must earn my keep at the writers table and toil. 

Pray the Lord come down and take pity on His children, satisfy us in the morning with His unfailing love, that we may sing for joy to the end of our lives.

We cannot fathom the undertaking of our lives by the Father. He knows every aspect of our movement. 
Even now, when the sadness of my being tastes excruciating, I know that He feels all of me. There is no reason to feel the overwhelmed

**06/06/2020 22:53**

How strange that the word mellow and it's meaning could manifest itself to me in the physical as a marshmallow would.

I feel like a mallow today, like a mallow coddled me until I gave in to the sublime mush.
There was no anger at waking up late, no fears of not getting enough done. Just the hope of living today, and allowing a present joy to wholely be with me. These are days that God reveals Himself to us, in the moments where we can feel and absorb a little of the beauty of His creation. Bask in admiration of His overlapping kingdoms. 

**09/06/2020 23:04**
I feel amped to work on my masters work tonight. That can only be through God.
Whatever wisdom I feel and have, is through His mercy.

Overcoming your own average. We're constantly comparing where and what we are right now to someone else. Someone else that has spent more time and thought honing in on something. Remembering that this is our race, alone, with God. Our only competition is our previous selves.

It is necessary to reset yourself and your mindset often, necessary to redefine your parameters. 
We often compare ourselves to our past selves and this isn't always the best way forward. Our current selves could be wounded and different in many ways. I am more emotional now, softer and lighter. Competition has never been the answer, it's the 1% that you grow everyday. The 1% sacrifice that you make for your north star. 

The quicker you move on to the next thing, the quicker you can start accomplishing new things.
Focus on you instead on what others are doing, on what others are able to do right now, focus on YOU, how to enable yourself to write and code better. To do better and impact the world, because you know it is part of you that is meant to touch people with words of meaning.

The food from home story.

I can tell it from the first person. 
It would be me telling stories, while unpacking the food, while eating  it. Retelling stories particular to durban, or to Chatsworth. A creative exercise in practicing writing about food, forming characters and plotting short stories. 

**15/06/2020 11:09**

My writing in the morning is never proper, or pleasing to me. It is messy and unordered, all over the place. I had a vision of writing a surreal food story yesterday. Of having sensations flood through you when preparing or indulging in a meal. Of the differences in life now and life then. 

The dissatisfied feeling ebbing through you and through your surroundings. That dissatisfied feeling becoming a void inside you. that reflects in everything the narrator sees and does. That everything settles once your body and spirit is content.

My days of leave feel fluttery, I want to do many things and just one thing of importance. I found today, that I am pleased again to sit down and work after the weekend break, again the the importance of abscence and break for growth and recovery from a difficult week that has been fought and gone through. I want to be a warrior, that doesn't relent. That fights for the Lord, with sword and shield and bow. And He will teach me how to wield the bow and arrow. Despite my outward appearance of lowly like facade, I feel strong and determined today. I feel at peace and content that the Lord is on my side. He is present and ready and His time is consistent and perfect. I trust the Lord, that He will guide my food steps and keep my hands and face steady. 

What is my intention today: 
*
To be in intent on whatever I am doing, to be consistent and to be enduring. *

*Writing is not something for pansies, and writing well is not for everybody. I want to write wholesome and surreal stories that comment on situations that no one is talking about. 
This is not something for the feint of heart. 

Stop focusing on other people and on other writers, you're too focused on them and for that reason, you have not yet found your own voice. Always over analysing and comparing yourself  to others. There is more that you could do, find your own voice. *


I want to write a review for jane eyre so that I can read again. 
Write more of the food story, this is a difficult task as you cannot draw as yet, so you have to draw with  your words. 
You have to send a mail to coulter with an update on your masters work.

Falling in love with your work is the answer and should result in a passionate response to your work, whatever that may be. Pursuing it a little everyday. Read biographies and feel less alone, there were writers that existed before you and were brave enough to explore the difficult natures of realities through words. 
Writers are privy to the prophetic and poets are provy to the language of the Lord. 

**16:27**
I must explore who I am when I am in the role of the writer. I must be objective and fully immersed in the characters themslves. Displaced when necessary from me. Gain momentum, this is the most valuable thing that you can achieve when starting out, you need momentum with your work itself. If you can gain it with your masters, you can gain it with this as well.

Reviewing Jane Eyre, felt like a meditative process where I brought up from ingestion
the book I had recently consumed. Falling in love with it's wild and conceled language. 
Bronte so brilliantly covered up the sexuality of it all with dear angst. 

A modernist novel has a lot to do with gaps and what is left out and not said. 
Bronte has this as well, it's just less obvious. 

We can leave out something, and it becomes noticable to the reader.
Can we perhaps put something, that isn't supposed to be there?
Make it new...

I feel overcome by feelings of admiration for these women of the 19th century. Braving for adventure and want for more.

I seek pentitance today, wondering with my pride. My human cross that I can't bear to bear any longer. My dreams screamed of me being with child and shamed therefore for my heaviness and inability to self-control. I wonder the basics of our narscissism, we cannot compare with the creator. Entirely His from birth to present. I feel my duty to surrender to the Lord, to be His. 
There are forces around us, moving like whisps that we cannot see. His fortress protects us and guards us from the parrallel wars looming ahead. 

I felt strangeness creeping up, but the Lord is my guide and a lamp before me. He surrounds me with light and keeps me safe. There are skills that I do not have, then again, everything that we have acquired is by His grace, His mercy, He allows us to have. To pursue quietly, fervently and pray continuously for the Lord to always be by your side. 

There is a tempest brewing inside and outside for time to the Lord is like space, continous and everywhere. To understand time, we can examine space and apply what we see to time. 
God is present and past and forevermore. My future is in Yaweh's hands. I want to do something for my spiritual father for father's day. I don't know what, I don't know how. I don't fee; I have the skill.

Comparative reading is what academics does for you that life does not force you to engage with. Reading many different texts and comparing them. 

1. Decide what you would like to learn
2. Create a bibliography
3. skim and choose the books that are actually of value
4. comparatively read both texts

**19/06/2020 00:16**

A surreal story around sharing, what it means to connect with others on this level.
Closing your eyes and allowing music to wash over you while other individuals are sharing the same love, connects you to them.
