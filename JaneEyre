We know in our deepest hearts that reading and writing go together 
in twined fingers and clasped palms. 

The height of my experience with jane eyre is not at all what i expected, the words
exchanged between edward and jane. Their fanciful words reflect their passionate
souls. One can't help but wish for a passion akin. 

The name of plain jane, when uttered by rochester makes ones tongue curl and almost
pine to be called jane, spritely jane, janet!

"will you hear reason, jane? or i will try violence."

Our dear master rochester oh how I pity him and his unfortunate circumstances. He is our's, 
the reader's elfish and otherworldly one. Unpredictable an scary. Oh, but we can't help but love him as Jane herself does.

## Wedding scene
*"I looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me. His whole face was colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint*. 
*He disavowed nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things. Without speaking, without smiling, without seeming to recognise*
*in me a human being, he only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side."*

*"you did right to hold fast to eachother," I said: as if the monster-splinters were living things, and could hear me* 
*"I think scathed as you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life in you yet, rising out of 
the adhesion at the faithful, honest roots: you will never have green leaves more -- never more see birds making nests and 
singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to sympathise with
him in his decay." As I looked up at them, the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
her disk was blood - red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me on bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly
in the deep drift of cloud.*  


## morning after engagement


**Mental illness**
**Dialog in jane eyre**
**Design of Mr Rochester's character in Jane eyre**
**Mr Rochester vs Heathcliff**
**Currer Bell**

The conversation pieces in Jane eyre caught me. The dialogue between Edward and jane are wonderfully captivating. 

Bertha represents the ghosts of our past that we hide, the dirty bits inside of us that we cannot bear the
world to see for our fear or losing acceptance. 

We must show that which is present that we ignore. 
Rochester believes that bertha cannot speak, bronte describes bertha as snarling and grunting -
as one that has been removed from language (language is one of the things that define and set us
apart as humans, what other aspects would  you say we have that set us apart?), her language becomes that of signs
and she shows her anger via blood and fire. 

Jane and Bertha are closely related. 
Bertha is hidden and marginalised, Jane is always marginalised. 

Jane eyre is represenative of the repressed of the controlled and those of no roots or inheritance. 
She has no kick-start to society, there is no trust fund to set her up and house her. One must bear the lense of an 
18 centurary woman when reading Jane eyre and marvel at the sheer valley of emotions that charlotte is able to draw out
with words and the wonderful restraint in her protagonist, beauitfully complemented by Edward's marvelous fervor and Bertha's wild nature. 

We meet with Jane as her readers and she introduces us with the supernatural instance that sets the goth tone of thrilling uncertainty for 
rest of the novel. She is then, Harry Potter. Without kin, knows no feeling of love and kindness and is tortured for reasons that are privy only
to the vile and lifeless at heart. Jane is locked in the red room (her cupboard under the stairs) and experiences something divine rush through her.
She experiences what must be a fit of epilepsy and is woken to feel drained and strained for endurance of life. 

Janes passionate nature, we see raw and wild when young. Her kindling heart is wild with fury and entitlement and wants, NEEDS to be loved. 
She lashes out with words against her accusing aunt, she will not be called a liar! 

 <<INSERT SOME OF JANE'S OUTBURST AGAINST HER AUNT HERE>>>

Soon sent off to a sponsored instituition, Lowood boarding school. Our Jane is not exactly in Hogwarts yet. 
These halls are sullen and the cement floors hold only strict rules and and whipped girls. Their shedule is tight and held
together by Holy texts and prayers, recited daily. Our Jane, prideful and full of feelings of revenge against her aunt is yet to 
meet with life's real cruelties. At Lowood she is put on display, to be named deceitful one; basking in the stares and hidden glances
of her sceniors: Jane is met with shame and despair that she must bear with straight faced emptiness, until she is allowed to repose.
Thus begins her experience. The climax of this period reaches when the school is overun by a spell of tyhpus and a new routine comes upon them
with better facilities now available to cater for the children's living conditions. Jane sneaks away to the room of her only friend, her dying friend. 
They sleep in eachothers arms; morning finds Helen Burns cold and taken away by the night rain storm, Jane is carried away before she could awaken
beside her now passed companion. 

Our narrator, now acquainted with more of life and with that of death thrives at ths school under mentorship and attention. She goes on to teach successfully at
the school. Jane, now 18, restless and ripe in womenhood yearns for more than the school walls. We are reminded again of her status, ie. zero status.
No relatives to assist her, no friends. Nothing. She advertises and is accepted into the Thornfield manor. 

Here it is, that the reader is welcomed into the body of the novel. All till this point has been a prelude, and introduction to our protagnist.
Serving to relate us to her, for us to feel a part of journey. We go with her to Thornfield hall, Jane is the governess of young Adelle. 
French and plain with little give for thought is Adelle; old and sensible is the house keeper ms. Fairfax. Our Jane, outwardly sensible and prudent;
passionate and fiery on the inside: grows restless in the halls of Thornfield. Thirsting for adventure. She has never known a man. 
She is curious and ready to burst from boredom, she is curious of the opposite sex. Jane is an observor, a wallflower and takes pleasure
in watching personalties. She presses Ms Fairfax for anything note worthy of Mr Rochester, the old lady's responses always safe and disappointing
for our Jane. 

"necessity compells me to make you useful"

On the road to Millcote, delivering a letter and stalling in the twilight. Her time to wander with the woodland creatures greeting the coolness of the evening. 
Jane stalls hates te return to the hall, grand, empty and bearing her restfulness no longer. She is met again with her impatience and
lack of gratitude for her place. Charlotte paints a scene here and shuts us into the life of our heroine with complete unknowing grace anf flawless
word gathering. We're transported into a scene slowed down in a novel: a yelping hound, almost fluttering forward; an ebony heap thrown sideways. We find a horse thrown over, the rider flat upon the grown. Jane, lunged out of her quiet somber, grasps the moment of adventure. To help this man, asserts herself to be of help. 
And so Mr Fairfax Rochester of Thornfield hall meets Jane. 

Jane unassuming, returns home dwelling on her adventure not knowing the manor's owner shall summon her the following evening and address
her directly for bewitching his horse. 

"Were you waiting for your people?"

Charlotte does her job wonderfully as storyteller, drawing us into Mister Rochester's physiognomy as Jane drinks in every bit of his facade and
passes objective judgement within. This master, scrutinises her drawings and we scrutinise him. All the while reader, cannot help but feel like the very silk
thread like being that Jane's personality beholds. Their journey of wits and words begin now. We wait for the conversations between Jane
and rochester to resume and hold on to the tip of our seats of sate our curiosity of the master. Is he falling in love with her?

Our surroundings at Thornfield Hall, are dark, gothic, eerie. There looms a mystery that we ignore as Jane does until she is presented with it directly.
Jane finds Rochester's room alight with fire and she drenches him and bed, calming the fire. 

"I knew, you would do me some good..... did not strike delight in me for no good"
We witness the fires that expose the spark in Mr Rochester for Jane, whom catches it and bears it with confusion and supressed joy. 
The memorable feelings of his not abondoning her mousy hands. 

The mystery of Thornfield played down once again, hidden away with under the blooms of the Master and Jane. 
Our mystery encapsulated by layers of the manor and people and a certain house keeper: Grace pool. Lurking in the shadows of the third floor,
as the scenario wanders around the behind of Jane's mind, she calms her curiosity each time, her passions from childhood tamed through the years of boarding
school. 

The road on which we perceive the tracks of the plot to be headed takes a momentary detour and Thornfield Hall plays guest house to high society and Mr Rochester
holds on his arm the lovely and "buxom" Blanche Ingram. 
We remember Mr Rochester's conversation with Jane on the field, as he shared his tale of Adelle and her mother the opera dancer. 

“You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre? Of course not: I need not ask you; because you never felt love. You have both sentiments yet to experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall waken it. You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in which your youth has hitherto slid away. Floating on with closed eyes and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base. But I tell you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer current- -as I am now.”

Jane is thrust now, fully into womanhood. Her sexuality is awakened with feelings of affection for her master that she must hide; I want to call her jealous 
but Jane's astute nature has addressed this with fair wisdom of observation that Miss ingram with beneath jealousy, Mr Rochester did not love her. 

“I have told you, reader, that I had learned to love Mr. Rochester; I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me—because I might pass hours in his presence and he would never once turn his eyes in my direction—because I saw all his attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would soon marry this very lady—because I read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her—because I witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.

There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances; though much to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy, if a woman in my position could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram's. But I was not jealous, or very rarely;—the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the feeling.”

Mr Rochester twists and touches Jane affectionately from affair and demands her prescene each evening, to attend the after dinner affairs. Pressing upon her eyes
the prescence of socialites and creating a physical, present divide that permeated every room. That of the governness and them. Jane did not belong with the house staff,
nor did she belong with the party. She is representative of the outcast that is surrounded by company and shunned by status. 
We are introduced to a strange guest that greets the party as a friend of Mr Rochester's, Richard Mason. While Rochester disguieses himself as a gypsy 
and attempts to draw Jane out and achieve a confession of love.
