**Ability: A**
-----------------------------------------------
Your skills as a BA are solid, I can always come to you with a business rule question and 
you try to answer me as fast as possible. If you do not know the answer off-hand we can always 
count on you to quickly check the documentation for us and revert back with the answer. 
You spent much time communicating with Jesse from IBR and kabelo (when she was still at AS) and 
aligning with them on the work that is to be done.

You've also assisted us in many occassions with holding the testers hands and assisting in crisis resolution.
I would really appreciate the assistance with some of the communication, if you recall there have been several 
ocassions when ive requested for you to translate what i want to say into 
something that is more readable
for all parties via email. This skill of yours is quite valuable and i think you should make use of it
more often. 

**attitude** : C

Jono you have exceptional ability in whatever you do, and whenever you take on a task you do it really well.
But sometimes the tasks that we have to do are not always the most stimulating or the most interesting or they 
may not seem to add any value to our personal careers, in these cases it can be tempting to deliver the bare minimum 
but our team needs to function as one unit and whatever we do i think we should try and handle it well and as Shashi 
would say: **over deliver**. Standardbank can be resistant to change but when we are there, represent entelect and 
I would like for us to show them what that means. 

There are periods when you are immensely pumped for work and you are more than willing to help out with anything extra, 
but there are also down periods when your enthusiasm fades and you can almost seem dissonant about work. 
You've had to deal with some difficult scenarios, with LDR being redesigned and our team not being able to start 
the payments rewrite and the enormous about of work you did for it being put on hold. I empathise with you on this,
and I encourage you to not let this damper your high spirits.  

You are usually the life of the party and for this reason it is noticeable when your mood is not doing great. 
Sometimes a snap reaction to the team can really affect the atmosphere and filter through. 

It was his uber eats idea. 

**Communication and Project Ownership (IBA)** B

As mentioned above, I value your effective communication skills, especially your use of suitable vocabulary
and choice of explainations. I try to learn from you in this regard and elaborate more in my reasoning when 
answering questions etc, I have also adopted your technique of copying an email and writing a response in read next to 
each point, thank you for that. 

You were able to assist me when I reached out for help for jira project access within the payments team to create tickets,
it would be great if you could assist me in following up on these minor requests with the client. There are times
when a request can get raised and nothing happens thereafter.

**Deadlines** A

You once said to the team that you bulldoze through work, that if you have a giant pile of work, you tend to
focus fully on it, even if it means working like 15 straight hours to get it done. I can attest to this, your work is
always on schedule and you definitely get things done. When a junior dev is struggling with something, such as when leantha 
was alone and was having some issues with her test cases, you sat and tried to assist and support her. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are times when it feels like you want to drop what is currently the focus and needs to be completed
and just focus on the fun, new stuff

Hennie 54%
--------------------------------------------------
Think of constructive feedback to offer to hennie.
Even if you write it here and distribute it later on. 

Thank you for being mindful of the team's state and recognising that I appreciate being kept up to date
with what is happening. 

We are a team that does not like to be micromanaged but there are times that abscence can result
in some members of team attempting to seize control and micromanage others in an attempt to validate themselves.

You are doubling as a team lead for our team and this has sometimes left us being the "last" for things like
arranging for vpn, you did arrange for the other team leads to assist us and we were not left in the dust, but it sometimes
feels hastey. --> explain what you mean here. 

Sometimes the team needs a consistent prescence to make them feel at ease everyday.

I'm aware that the grayston team and James Murray's team functions well and effectively on their own. 

Conflict resoltuion between myself and pierre and jono.

Because of your abscence, a lot happens when you are not around, people try to seize control and 
manage the team, they also spread incorrect ideas of you saying that you want them to be 
team lead.

Hennie is running the leadership training for all the team leads in sbg, including the data science chain. 

**Implementation Methodology (DvM)**


Bright
--------------------------------------------------
When under pressure from business to deliver, you can sometimes disappear and become
unresponsive. 

Me
--------------------------------------------------

- preferred method of contact for otp


Fabio
--------------------------------------------------

Bright once said to me, "there is nothing that you can give to Fabio and he won't be able to do it.
Whenever I go to him with a problem, I know it will be solved"

Sometimes not being able to listen to reason and see passed your own ego.

Coenraad
--------------------------------------------------
Try to embrace mindful when you're in meetings and discussions, a little more empathy
and eq can assist in your approach to things and how they are received. Being present 
but calm is great strength. 

We need to be able to balance what the client requires and what is best to deliver in these circumstances.
Over complicating a db design that is meant just for standardbanks internal use will not show signs of 
advanced skill but it will show signs of 

Being super opinionated about teams and forcing zoom on everyone. 

Reviews as an opportunity to encourage
--------------------------------------------------
Remember to encourage the team to give kudos to each other.. try to include that somewhere.

arlo
--------------------------------------------------
Your main line of communication is with me and within our team in the stand-ups and other meetings, you display effective and concise communication skills. I think we have managed fairly well in this area with it being just the 2 of us, it's going to change a bit considering the size of the upcoming project and team. 
When handling a deployment you have been responsible enough to send out the required comms and follow up if there is a failure. 
You also demonstrate excellent skills during demos when asked questions about any of the features that you have built.
You can use these skills that you have built to communicate more directly with the client and build stronger relationships.

attitude
--------------------------------------------------
you see through the many facades that most people wear, you can easily discern their intentions.
